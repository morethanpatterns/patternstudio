# PatternStudio

PatternStudio is a web-based pattern drafting workspace by **More Than Patterns**.

This project will become the home for tools that let you:

- create digital pattern drafts using specific patternmaking systems
- duplicate drafts to compare how measurement changes affect the pattern
- experiment with fitting solutions

This repo is currently in its early setup stage and will evolve as features are added.
